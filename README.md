## Contributions

I have a strong interest in contributing to open source projects, particularly within the Linux and Android communities, which are the systems for which I have a large population. Although I still don't have any successful contributions and don't have as much technical knowledge, I actively seek opportunities to do it and am excited to collaborate with other programmers on meaningful projects. If you have any suggestion or know of any project that may benefit from my skills, please do not hesitate to contact me!

Feel free to explore my repository and use any material or code you find useful. I am always working on new projects and exploring new technologies, so I am not afraid to check frequently for updates! Thank you for your visit, and I look forward to connecting with other programmers and contributing to the open-source code community.
